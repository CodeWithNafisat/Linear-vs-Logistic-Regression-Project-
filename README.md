# Linear-vs-Logistic-Regression-Project-

Regression Learning Projects
  Linear Regression
  Goal: Predict continuous outcomes using independent variables.
  Key Learnings:
  1. Data Cleaning
  2. Model adjustment & residual errors
  3. Best fit line & assumptions (linearity, equal variance, normal residuals.
  4. Evaluation metrics: RÂ², MAE, MSE, RMSE
  
  
Logistic Regression
Goal: Binary classification with probabilities mapped using the sigmoid function.
Applications Explored: Healthcare, banking, spam detection.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

ðŸ“Œ These projects helped me understand the mathematics, assumptions, and real-world challenges of regression models while applying them to practical use cases.
